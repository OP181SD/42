# 42
All my projects from the common core at school 42.

Libft: The Libft project involves creating your own custom C library, with functions for managing strings, arrays, linked lists, and more. This library serves as the foundation for many subsequent projects.

ft_printf: In this project, you implement a simplified version of the printf function in C, capable of formatting and displaying text with format specifiers, such as %s for strings and %d for integers.

get_next_line: This project requires you to write a function that reads a line from a file or standard input (e.g., a terminal) and returns it. It's often used for reading files line by line.

Born2beroot: It's a project focused on system administration and server management. You learn to configure a Debian server, secure a Linux system, and perform various administrative tasks.

so_long: The so_long project involves creating a simple 2D game using the mlx graphics library. It provides practice in C programming and graphics manipulation.

push_swap: This project is about sorting a set of integers using a limited set of operations on two stacks. You need to sort the integers using as few operations as possible.

pipex: Pipex is a program that allows you to redirect the output of one process to the input of another, simulating the functionality of pipe operators (|) in command-line operations.

 Philosophers: The Philosophers project simulates the classic "Dining Philosophers" problem, where multiple philosophers must share forks to eat. It highlights concepts of concurrency and synchronization in parallel programming.
 
minishell: Minishell involves creating a minimalist command-line shell in C. It allows you to execute commands and programs, manage input/output, and implement basic shell functionality.
